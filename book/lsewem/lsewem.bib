abstract ={The forward and adjoint operators for shot-profile least-squares migration are derived. The forward operator is demigration, and the adjoint operator is migration. The demigration operator is derived from the Born approximation. The process begins with a Green's function that allows for a laterally varying migration velocity model using the split-step approximation. Next, the earth is divided into horizontal layers, and within each layer the migration velocity model is made to be constant with respect to depth. For a given layer, (1) the source-side wavefield is propagated down to its top using the background wavefield. This gives a background wavefield incident at the layer's upper boundary. (2) The layer's contribution to the scattered wavefield is computed using the Born approximation to the scattered wavefield and the background wavefield. (3) Next, its scattered wavefield is propagated back up to the measurement surface using, again, the background wavefield. The measured wavefield is approximated by the sum of scattered wavefields from each layer. In the derivation of the measured wavefield, the shot-profile migration geometry is used. For each shot, the resulting wavefield modeling operator takes the form of a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, and this is used to write down its adjoint, the shot-profile migration operator. This forward/adjoint pair is used for shot-profile least-squares migration. Shot-profile least-squares migration is illustrated with two synthetic examples. The first uses data collected over a four-layer acoustic model, and the second uses data from the Sigsbee 2a model.},

abstract ={The split-step Fourier method is developed and applied to migrating stacked seismic data in two and three dimensions. This migration method, which is implemented in both the frequency-wavenumber and frequency-space domains, takes into account laterally varying velocity by defining a reference slowness (reciprocal of velocity) as the mean slowness in the migration interval and a perturbation term that is spatially varying. The mean slowness defines a reference vertical wavenumber which is used in the frequency-wavenumber domain to downward continue the data across a depth interval as in constant-velocity phase-shift migration. The perturbation term is used to define a 'source' contribution that is taken into account by the application of a second phase shift in the frequency-space domain. Since the method does not include the effects of second and higher order spatial derivatives of the slowness field, the method theoretically is accurate only when there are no rapid lateral slowness variations combined with steep angles of propagation. However, synthetic and real examples indicate that good results are obtained for realistic geologic structures.},
