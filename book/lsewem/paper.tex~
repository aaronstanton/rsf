\section{Introduction}
Least squares migration aims to find the inverse of a modelling operator such that the migrated data fits the observations in a least squares sense. It offers an improvement to the adjoint or migration operator in the presence of noise, missing data, or poor subsurface illumination Citation. Elastic migration carries the same objectives as the acoustic case, but suffers from the additional complications of polarization and more constrictive aliasing conditions of the S-wave mode. 

\section{Theory}

\subsection{Migration of elastic data}
Much work has been done on the migration of elastic data. \cite{chang1987elastic} apply RTM to  

A common point of all elastic migration techniques is the need for seperation of data into potentials. The next section discusses seperation in isotropic media.

\subsection{wavefield seperation}

For isotropic media, the relationship between two a component wavefield and P and S-wave potentials is given by the divergence and curl respectively

\begin{equation}
p = \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z}; 
sv = \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial z}; 
\end{equation}

The derivatives in this equation can be evaluated using finite differences or via Fourier transform 

\begin{align}
P(\omega,k_x) = i k_x U_x(\omega,k_x) + i k_z(v_s) U_z(\omega,k_x); 
SV(\omega,k_x) = i k_x U_z(\omega,k_x) + i k_z(v_p) U_x(\omega,k_x); 
\end{align}

\citep{etgen1988}.

This can be written as a linear operator

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
	p\\
	s\\
\end{bmatrix}
=\mathbf{H}
\begin{bmatrix}
	u_x\\
	u_z\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{F_x}^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
	ik_x & ik_z(v_s)\\
 -ik_z(v_p) & ik_x\\
\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{F_x}
\end{equation}

Alternatively, to recompose potentials into wavefield components we apply

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
	d_x\\
	d_z\\
\end{bmatrix}
=\mathbf{H}^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
	p\\
	s\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

where
 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H}^{-1} = \mathbf{F_x}^{-1} \frac{1}{k_x^2 + k_z(v_p)k_z(v_s)}
\begin{bmatrix}
	-ik_x & ik_z(v_s)\\
	-ik_z(v_p) & -ik_x\\
\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{F_x}
\end{equation}

Give small demonstration of the operator $\mathbf{H}$, it works well on noise-free fully sampled data.



Under the Born approximation a scatterer is considered as a perturbation within a smooth background medium.  

Derive split step migration from the Born approximation. Refer to Kaplan et al (2010). 

Finally, show in operator form:

In Split-Step migration the propagator is given by:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{B}\mathbf{F}_x\mathbf{C}\mathbf{F}_x^{-1}
\end{equation}

Where $\mathbf{C}$ is a phase-shift operator \citep{gazdag1978wave}, and $\mathbf{B}$ is the Split-Step correction \citep{Stoffa01041990}. 

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{L}^* = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{P} \mathbf{\Phi_s}\mathbf{P} \mathbf{\Phi_g}
\end{equation}

$\mathbf{A}$ is the imaging condition.

If the imaging condition is taken to be migration to zero offset then $\mathbf{A}$ is simply a row vector that multiplies the source wavefield with the complex conjugate of the receiver wavefield and sums over frequency. This is the zero lag cross correlation of the source and receiver wavefields. 

Figure ??? shows an example of applying the migration operator to a single shot over a three layer model. For migration it is best to use the decompostion operator $\mathbf{H}$ directly, rather than the adjoint of the recomposition operator, $(\mathbf{H}^-1)^T$, which is used in the inversion process.

Angle gathers are formed using the method described in \cite{rickett2002offset}.

\subsection{split step modelling}

Once you develop the operator notation for migration, take the adjoint of this for the forward operator.



\subsection{least squares inversion}


The cost function for elastic least squares migration with quadratic regularization is
\begin{equation}
J = || \mathbf{H}^{-1}\mathbf{L}\mathbf{m} - \mathbf{d} ||^2_2 + \mu ||\mathbf{m}||^2_2
\end{equation}
where $J$ is the cost to be minimized, $\mathbf{H}^{-1}$ is the Helmholtz recomposition operator, $\mathbf{L} = [\mathbf{L_{pp}} \; \mathbf{L_{ps}}]$ is the modelling operator, $\mathbf{m}=[\mathbf{m_{pp}} \; \mathbf{m_{ps}}]^T$ are the migrated data, and $\mathbf{d}=[\mathbf{d_{x}} \; \mathbf{d_{z}}]^T$ are the x and z components of the input data.

The foward and adjoint operators used in this inversion assume that mode conversion only occurs at the reflector. Alternatively the decomposition/ recompostion operator can be built directly into the migration operator, $L$, where it is applied at each depth step. \cite{bale2006} uses propagator matrices derived from the Christoffel equation to decompose and recompose anisotropic wavefields at individual depth steps for wave equation migration.

\subsection{preconditioning}

Rational for preconditioning, FK fan filtering of angle gathers, demonstration on 1 angle gather.

\begin{equation}
J = || \mathbf{H}^{-1}\mathbf{L}\mathbf{m} - \mathbf{d} ||^2_2 + \mu ||\mathbf{D}\mathbf{m}||^2_2
\end{equation}

Let $\mathbf{z}=\mathbf{D}\mathbf{m}$, then by a change of variables
\begin{equation}
J = || \mathbf{H}^{-1}\mathbf{L}\mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{z} - \mathbf{d} ||^2_2 + \mu ||\mathbf{z}||^2_2
\end{equation}
we can simply choose $\mathbf{D}^-1$ to be any operator that emphasizes good features in our model. In our case we chose an FK fan filter acting on angle gathers.
